# Amsterdam App

We are creating a native app for citizens, entrepreneurs, and visitors of the City of Amsterdam to provide information, allow communication, and streamline transactions.

## Installation

The [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) offer a good overview of how to set up your development environment. Specific instructions for this project:

- Clone the repository
  - from Azure: `git clone git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/CloudCompetenceCenter/Amsterdam-App/Amsterdam-App amsterdam-app-frontend`
  - or from GitHub: `git clone git@github.com:Amsterdam/amsterdam-app-frontend.git`
- Set Node version
  - Install the used node version:
    - Linux/MacOS: `nvm install`
    - Windows: `nvm install $(Get-Content .nvmrc)`
  - Select the used node version
    - Linux/MacOS: `nvm use`
    - Windows: `nvm use $(Get-Content .nvmrc)`
- Install Node dependencies: `npm i`.
- For iOS development, install other dependencies:
  - Check if you have Ruby Gems (`gem -v`), if not, install via homebrew `brew install brew-gem` or <https://rubygems.org/>
  - Go to `/ios`
  - Install bundler (Ruby gem manager): `gem install bundler:2.2.33`
  - Install/update the gems with bundler: `bundle update`
  - Install pods: `pod install`
- Get the necessary files and add them to the project
  - See "Secret files" below
- To run the app on a simulator/emulator
  - Start the iOS phone simulator: `npm run ios:phone:dev`
  - Start the Android phone emulator: `npm run android:phone:dev`
  - Other options are available: to build a production version of the app or to run on tablet simulator/emulator
    - Make sure to add @Pixel_C_API_30 to your devices in Android Studio's AVD Manager (Android tablet emulator)
- We recommend installing the [React Native debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger)
  - For Mac via Homebrew: `brew install --cask react-native-debugger`

### Secret files

To build the app locally, you need these files. These files contain credentials or API keys, so they are not part of the repo.

- `android/app/google-services.json` (Firebase config/key for Android)
- `ios/GoogleService-Info.plist` (Firebase config/key for iOS)
- `android/sentry.properties` (Sentry config/key for Android)
- `ios/sentry.properties` (Sentry config/key for iOS)
- `.env` (environment variables to be used in the JS, see `.env.example`)

## Git

- We rebase feature branches – don’t merge `main` or `develop` back into them.
- We largely work according to [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

### Release

- Branch from develop and call it release/\[version-number\].
- Once reviewed, pull branch into main and tag it with its version number.

## Push notifications

To test push notifications locally, do the following:

1. Log into Chrome with the Team Communicare account
2. Go to <https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/>
3. Fill in for scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase.messaging`
4. Select Team Communicare account
5. Click button ‘Exchange authorization code for tokens’ and get the `access_token`
6. Open your Postman app
7. Set header: `Authorization: Bearer /[access_token/]`
8. Enter body of this signature, where `token` is the Firebase token of your device (see code):

```json
{
  "message": {
    "token": "alovelyfcmtoken",
    "data": {
      "linkSourceid": "f296eba1-189f-477e-8302-44ffc369f032",
      "type": "WarningCreatedByProjectManager"
    },
    "notification": {
      "body": "Er is nieuws over een project!",
      "title": "Nieuws-update Bullebak"
    }
  }
}
```

## Deeplinks

These are links from outside the app that will open the app and trigger something:

- Authorizing project managers: `amsterdam://project-manager/:id` (`id` is generated by our backend).

## Keep your code secure

Add new files containing API keys or credentials to `.gitignore`. These files may not be pushed to the repo.

We use `detect-secrets` to scan the codebase for secrets. This results in a .secrets.baseline file in the root of the project:

- <https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets>

## Storybook

- Run locally with `npm run storybook`
- [Production URL] (<https://amsterdam.github.io/amsterdam-app-storybook>)
