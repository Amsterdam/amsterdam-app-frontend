## Piwik configuration

To confige Piwik, you need to set two env vars: a URL and an ID.

- `PIWIK_PRO_URL` and `PIWIK_PRO_ID` for production
- `PIWIK_PRO_URL_ACCEPT` and `PIWIK_PRO_ID_ACCEPT` for anything else

For local development, they can be set in the `.env` file. Do not use the production URL/ID for development work. This way we don't "pollute" the production data. For the app builds they are set in the variable group "React Native Piwik Pro Analytics".

## A note on privacy

> Anonymization is the feature that allows tracking a user’s activity for aggregated data analysis even if the user doesn’t consent to track the data. If a user does not agree to be tracked, he will not be identified as the same person across multiple sessions. In other words: if the anonymization is enabled, a new visitor ID will be created each time the application starts.

> Anonymization is enabled by default.

We have not changed the default: anonymization is enabled.

(See: https://github.com/PiwikPRO/react-native-piwik-pro-sdk#data-anonymization)

## Sessions

As context for the above privacy note and the instructions below, it is useful to know what a session is:

> A session represents a set of user’s interactions with your app. By default, Analytics is closing the session after 30 minutes of inactivity, counting from the last recorded event in session and when the user will open up the app again the new session is started.

This can be configured with `setSessionTimeout`. We currently use the default of 30 minutes of inactivity.

## How to log things

### Basic examples

A log will usually be triggered by an _action_ and have a _category_ and a _name_. With custom dimensions, additional data can be added to a log, which can be part of the event itself or can be connected to the session.

```tsx
export const HomeButton = ({moduleName, onPress}: Props) => {
  const {trackCustomEvent} = usePiwik()
  const address = useMyAddress()

  const handlePress = useCallback(() => {
    // log the event with category and action
    trackCustomEvent(
      // add a unique, specific name
      name: `Navigate to ${moduleName}`,
      PiwikAction.buttonPress,
      // optionally add predefined custom dimensions
      {
        [PiwikDimensions.hasAddress]: !!address.toString(),
      },
      PiwikCategory.home,
    )
    onPress()
  },
  [address, moduleName, trackCustomEvent])

  return <Button onPress={handlePress} />
}
```

### Methods

We usually log using a custom event: `trackCustomEvent` (see https://github.com/PiwikPRO/react-native-piwik-pro-sdk#tracking-custom-events).

There are some special logging options:

- `trackScreen`: screen views; this is integrated in the navigation (see below)
- `trackApplicationInstall`: is triggered the first launch of the app only
- `trackOutlink`: any linking to web or other apps via a URL
- `trackSearch`: track search queries
- `trackSocialInteraction`, `trackDownload`, `trackGoal`: not used at the moment, but could be useful
- `trackImpression`, `trackInteraction` (ads); `trackEcommerce`, `trackCampaign` (measure specific business/commerce/marketing objectives); `trackProfileAttributes` (profile a user accross platforms): commercial features, we won't use these

There are various other settings available. We use only `setIncludeDefaultCustomVariables` which automatically adds platform version (device info), OS version and app version to logs.

### Category, action and name

Every custom event has a _category_ and an _action_. The _category_ we use to distinguish between modules, or we set it to 'general' if the data is not related to a module. The _action_ is whatever triggered the log, e.g. app coming to foreground or a button press.

See `src/types/piwik.ts` for the definitions of the categories and actions.

The name is the unique metric that you are logging, e.g. "the waste guide module has been enabled".

### Dimensions

What are dimensions? You can use them to add additional data to a log event.

> Dimensions are attributes of a log that describe specific characteristics.

There are broadly 2 types of information that you may want to log:

1. general information about the user, their preferences, profile or settings
2. something has happened (push notification received) or the user has done something (tapped a button)

For the 1st case (general information) we use a custom _session_ dimension. This means that if the value changes during a session, the value will be updated. We log a bunch of session dimensions when the app comes to the foreground, but they can be added to other events too.

For the 2nd case we use custom dimensions (as opposed to custom _session_ dimensions) to pass additional data.

See `src/types/piwik.ts` for the definitions of the custom dimensions and the custom session dimensions. Dimensions 1-17 match the default dimensions used in the organisation (see [Aansluitgids](https://hoofdstad.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AmsterdamApp/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B558373BD-BDBF-4268-BA07-DBB004B64AC8%7D&file=Technisch%20-%20Aansluitgids%20DAP%20-%20Generiek%20Meetplan.pptx)).

#### Create dimensions

Dimensions have to be created in the interface first: https://dap.amsterdam.nl/analytics/#/[PIWIK_ID]/settings/custom-dimensions/. Each dimension gets an integer index, to which we refer in our code. This index is shared between session and non-session dimensions, so 1 could be a session dimension, 2 could be a non-session dimension, etc.

Add the new dimension to `src/types/piwik.ts`. See: https://help.piwik.pro/support/reports/custom-dimension/

#### The criteria for logging session dimensions

A session dimension is often not related to a specific action. If that is the case, we can log them on start up and when the app comes to the foreground. See `src/hooks/piwik/useLogGeneralAnalytics.ts`. Note that you can log session dimensions multiple times. E.g. the metric "user has given location permission" should be logged on start up/foreground, but can also be updated immediately after the user gives his/her permission in a dialog.

## Tracking screens

The screen tracking is integrated in the React Navigation (see: `src/hooks/navigation/useHandleNavigationStateChange.ts`)
