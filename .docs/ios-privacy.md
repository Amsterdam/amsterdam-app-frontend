# iOS Privacy

Apple offers a number of APIs, which is what they call features of the operation system that can be used/accessed by the app. Usage of these features has to be declared in the "privacy manifest": `./ios/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`.

Packages should declare this themselves; in other words: we should not have to do this, unless we write custom native code using these APIs. But in case of an issue with a package, we can solve it by adding the declaration ourselves.

The file contains key-value pairs of:

- `NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType`: the name of the API, e.g. `NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryFileTimestamp`
- `NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons`: array of codes which describe the way the API is used

See [the docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api) for all types, codes and their descriptions.
