# Frequently solved problems

Here we document useful tips and solutions to (relatively) common problems with building the app.

## Ruby install issues

If you run into issues installing the correct Ruby version via gems, you can manually install the correct version using http://rbenv.org/ or https://rvm.io/

## react-native start fails

Sometimes building the JS fails due to caching issues, for example after changes in the import aliases or the babel config. If the cause of the issue is unclear, a good place to start is to clear all relevant caches:

- `$ npm cache clear -f` (clear npm cache)
- `$ watchman watch-del-all` (clear watchman cache)
- `$ npx react-native start --reset-cache` (clear metro cache and start RN)

## Android or iOS build fails

When faced with an unclear error during the native build, some options are:

- Remove `package-lock.json` and `/node_modules`
- Run `npm i`

You can also run the `clean` script command to do this for you.

### iOS specific

Occasionally a build fails because of outdated data in the build folder. When building with XCode, there is an option to clear the build folder: CMND+SHIFT+K. Alternatively, you can usually find the path to the build folder in the build/error logs and manually delete the folder.

- Remove `ios/Pods` and `Podfile.lock`
- In `/ios`:
  - `bundle update` (update Ruby gems, including Cocoapods)
  - `pod install --repo-update` (install Pods and force downloading the latest versions of the repos)

After you've reinstalled npm packages and pods, it can happen that pods have been downgraded. Whenever this is the case, do the following:

- Run `pod repo update` (Updates the local clone of pods + versions)
- If some pods are still downgraded, run `pod update` (Updates the pods to the latest version possible)

Occasionally, something will be cached outside of the build folder. To make sure a build is completely clean, you can to delete the DerivedData folder:

- Look in the build log what folder in DerivedData is used for the build, e.g. `/Users/you/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/AmsterdamApp-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzab/`
- Go to the folder `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
- Then delete the relevant `AmsterdamApp-...` folder

You can also run the `clean` script command to clean the iOS project.

#### Archive failed

During the Fastlane `build_app` task:

```shell
** ARCHIVE FAILED **
[...]
Exit status: 65
```

This will happen if in Xcode, in the list of "Supported Destinations" there are destinations other than iPhone and iPad, e.g. "Mac Catalyst" or "Mac designed for iPhone" (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74275390/fastlane-with-xcode-14-archive-failed). If any target has any "Mac" destination, the build may fail. Known issue (sort of) for Xcode 14; seen with Xcode 14.3.

### Android specific

#### Installation issues

If `react-native run-android` can build the app, but cannot install the app on your device, then:

1. Make sure there is no other version of the app installed on the device.
2. If the install still fails, then check whether an APK has been created. Depending on the type of build, you will find is in a subfolder of `src/android/app/build/outputs/apk/`. Then run `adb install` plus the correct relative path, e.g.

```bash
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/dev/debug/app-dev-debug.apk
```

#### Cannot connect to debugger

If the app on your Android device cannot connect to the debugger, run `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081`.

## iOS emails with "ITMS-91053: Missing API declaration"

Apple offers a number of APIs, i.e. features of the operation system that can be used/accessed by the app. Usage of some of these features has to be declared in a "privacy manifest" (_PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy_ file). Packages should declare a manifest themselves. In other words: we should not have to do this, unless we write custom native code using these APIs.

If we get emails with this ITMS-91053 error, we can run a scan script to find the culprit:

- https://gist.github.com/MarcoEidinger/22feb1588c3d7be41c42853a77e52772/
- https://github.com/Wooder/ios_17_required_reason_api_scanner

Then we should report the issue (if necessary) and when fixed, update the offending package.
