                    You can enter your address to look up where to dispose of
                    bulky (oversized) waste. This also helps to locate the
                    nearest waste and glass containers.

                    The City often performs maintenance on streets, bridges,
                    quays, and buildings. ‘Werkzaamheden’ lists the projects in
                    your area. You can follow a project in the app. If you do
                    so, we keep you up-to-date with any construction work.

                    Is a waste container full, a lamppost not working, or is
                    rubbish lying on the street? You can report any of that
                    within the app. We will take care of these problems as
                    quickly as possible.

                  This version of the Amsterdam app offers topics that benefit
                  everyone. It is the start of more features and languages to
                  come. We’ll keep improving the app this way.
